Changelog
#########

This project follows a simple release-oriented changelog. Entries describe the
changes shipped in each tagged version.

It is structured where the most recent changes and versions are at the top of their
respective sections.

Since prerelease ``0.1.1rc2``, when making new tags (including prereleases),
any change content in the `Active` section should be moved to it's respective section
before the new tag is commited and pushed. Meaning the last commit in any tag should
be ``Moved active changes to {version tag}`` or when moving prerelease logs to a
release log, the commit then should be ``Moved prerelease logs of {version} into publish``.

Active
======

Here is what has been pushed into the *main* branch of the repository,
but has yet to be released as a version.

Changes:

* Added environment to ``release.yml`` workflow.

PreReleases
===========

Here you'll find what is in prerelease tags.
This is cleared when the official release of the
prereleases arrives.
This is mainly for organization purposes.

ALL GOOD. NO PRERELEASES.

Published
