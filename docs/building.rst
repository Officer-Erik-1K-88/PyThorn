Building The Docs
=================

The documentation sources live directly in the ``docs/`` directory and are
structured for Sphinx.

Sphinx Configuration
--------------------

The Sphinx configuration file is [conf.py](/mnt/programming/Libs/Python/PyThorn/docs/conf.py).

It currently enables:

* ``sphinx.ext.autodoc``
* ``sphinx.ext.napoleon``

Suggested build commands
------------------------

From the repository root, common approaches are:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m sphinx -b html docs docs/_build/html

or, when ``sphinx-build`` is available on ``PATH``:

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html

Notes
-----

If Sphinx was installed into a virtual environment or a different interpreter
than the shell default, use the matching Python executable for the build
command.

Packaging And Release Tags
==========================

Package builds use ``setuptools-scm`` to derive the version from Git tags.
That means releases should be cut from tagged commits instead of by editing a
hard-coded version string in the source tree.

Tag format
----------

Use annotated tags in ``vX.Y.Z`` format:

* ``v0.1.0`` for the first public release
* ``v0.1.1`` for a bugfix release
* ``v0.2.0`` for a backwards-compatible feature release
* ``v1.0.0`` when the public API is considered stable

Recommended release flow
------------------------

From the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   git status
   python -m pip install --upgrade build twine
   python -m build
   python -m twine check dist/*

Create the release tag on the commit you want to publish:

.. code-block:: bash

   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "PyThorn 0.1.0"

Then verify what version ``setuptools-scm`` resolved:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m build

If the build output looks correct, push the commit and tag:

.. code-block:: bash

   git push origin main
   git push origin v0.1.0

For a dry run, upload to TestPyPI first:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

Then publish the same built artifacts to PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m twine upload dist/*

Development versions
--------------------

Commits after a release tag will automatically build as development versions
derived from the most recent tag. To keep those versions meaningful, tag every
public release and avoid rewriting published tags.

GitHub Actions Publishing
-------------------------

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at
``.github/workflows/publish.yml``.

Behavior:

* pushing a tag such as ``v0.1.1`` builds the ``piethorn`` distribution and
  publishes it to PyPI
* manually running the workflow can publish the selected ref to TestPyPI or
  PyPI

The workflow uses ``setuptools-scm``, so it checks out the full Git history and
tags before building.

PyPI configuration
------------------

The workflow is designed for trusted publishing rather than long-lived API
tokens.

Configure both PyPI and TestPyPI to trust this repository's workflow:

* owner: ``Officer-Erik-1K-88``
* repository: ``PyThorn``
* workflow: ``publish.yml``
* environment: ``pypi`` for PyPI and ``testpypi`` for TestPyPI

After that setup:

* create and push a ``vX.Y.Z`` tag to publish to PyPI
* use the manual workflow dispatch to dry-run a build against TestPyPI first
